# About

The goal of this project is to provide an easy and convenient way of integrating OpenSteetMaps into JavaFX via a custom component. This is accomplished by rendering OpenStreetMaps data with mapsforge,  and rendering that to a JavaFX SwingNode. Eventually I hope to add helper functions and full map customizability into this widget.
